                                             We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we 
      
                                             offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host 
      
                                            the service at a co-location facility for servers. Where we utilize third parties for the 
      
                                             processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and

                                               How Long Do We Retain User Data? <br>
      
                                            Currently, we plan to retain user data while an account is active and for at least three 
      
                                            years afterward. We may alter this practice according to legal and business 
      
                                             requirements. For example, we may lengthen the retention period for some data if 
      
                                             needed to comply with law or voluntary codes of conduct. Unless otherwise 
      
                                             prohibited, we may shorten the retention period for some types of data if needed to 
      
                                             free up storage space.<br>
